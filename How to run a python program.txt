1. Save the whole script, line by line, in the text file.

2. Prepend the document with this line: 
#!/home/oceanw/anaconda3/bin/python3
(that's my development environment)

3. In terminal, type 
chmod +x Gamma.py
where Gammma.py is the example name of the python script I've used here.

4. (still in terminal)In the correct directory, type 
./Gamma.py
