0. Include whatever theory that needs to be included?
	i) Decay scheme: explain that they can be looked up in some source
	ii)Shape of the spectrum obtained
1. Resolution section:
	i)  Insert data of whole spectrum
	ii) Insert data of high and low energy region separated
	III)Show how it's better fitted to your own defined function (credit to the scipy code)
	iv) Refer to appendix for the Zoomed In Spectra + tables for calculation
2. Efficiency section
	i) Geometric Efficiency value error propagation: refer to the back.
	ii)Refer to appendix for the Zoomed In Spectra + tables for calculation, and error propagation of the geometric factor
	iii)Show the general trend
3. Calibrations:
	i)  Refer to a 152 Eu spectrum at the back, plus the data fitting table, and where the error propagation and inversion of function is done.
	ii) Show linear calibration, and the residuals' trend.
	iii)Show quadratic removes this trend.
	IV) attemp cubic fit?
4. Conclusion:
	i) Brief trend of Energy resolution,
	ii)Brief trend of Efficiency,
	iii)Summary of elements that was identified
	IV) copy to book
5. Improvement:
	i) A better calibration function may be considered, as this one doesn't seem to decrease quickly enough.
	ii) Semi-Automation can be implemented by some SQL code plugged into the nndc data base?
5. In Appendix, include:
	i)LaTeX Derivation
	ii)Graphs: 
		Explain where does the value come from, i.e. centroid and counts
		(the number of counts is summed and subtracted by the background by the Fit() function which is part of the ROOT program developed by CERN. )
	iii)Sources!
	iv)Label equations and figures
