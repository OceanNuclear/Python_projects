The top directory contains all scripts,

The function of the scripts are described in the first few lines.

Most of the mathematical conversion functions used by the other scripts are found inside of quat.py and generalLibrary.py;
The scripts themselves only contain plotting functions (i.e. the actual functions to initiate the plot canvas, etc.)

If one wishes to use these scripts they must have matplotlib (a Python module) install.

Functions are usually named explicitly; or sometimes named as <input>_<output>, e.g. cartesian_spherical means this function takes in cartesian coordinates and outputs in spherical coordinates.
