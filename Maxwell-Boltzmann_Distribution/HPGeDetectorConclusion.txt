mass of e/ mass of u = 0.0005485799093287202
For room T: fraction = 4.01531030647e-11 (regardless of the mass, because the mass is only part of the constant that scales the velocity axis.)
For Liquid Nitrogen: fraction = too close to zero (the only min. value storable in the program is 1.11022302463e-16) , it got interpreted as zero. fml.
